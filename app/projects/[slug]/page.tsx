    fullDescription: `ClassifyAI is an easy-to-use web application that helps users create image classification models without writing any code. Designed to be simple and accessible, it works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.

The app guides users through four clear steps:

1. Class Creation: Users collect their dataset by capturing images from their camera and/or uploading existing images for each class. This step is focused on gathering data to train the model.

2. Parameter Setup: Users can adjust training settings like learning rate, batch size, and number of training rounds. Data augmentation can also be applied in this step to help improve model performance. The samples of augmented data can be seen in the image above. Helpful tips explain what each setting does.

3. Model Training: The model is trained directly in the browser using TensorFlow.js. This keeps user data private and removes the need for any server. During training, users can see real-time progress through charts and metrics.

4. Real-time Testing: After training, users can test the model right away with new images. The app shows predictions along with confidence scores, making it easy to check how well the model performs.`,

    fullDescription: `SASO E-Commerce is a website made to help with food orders at the yearly SASO food festival, which is organized by IWKZ e.V. It was first used at the SASO 2022 festival and was part of a move to make the event more modern and digital.

The website was built to handle special needs at the festival, such as many people ordering at the same time, keeping track of food stock in real time, and making payments easy and quick. It had to be strong enough to support hundreds of users at once while still being simple and fast to use.

The main goals were to make it easier for visitors to order food, shorten wait times, improve customer satisfaction, and help vendors see their stock levels in real time. It also allowed for contactless ordering, which was important after the pandemic, and provided useful reports and data for the event organizers.

This website was made not only for customers but also for the admin side, where admins can manage the orders made by customers and keep everything organized during the event.

Because the first version worked well, it later became IW-Commerce â€” a more flexible system that can be used for different events and vendors.`,

Background: Preattentive vision helps us quickly find patterns, differences, or unusual things in what we see.

Purpose: This app is made to teach and show how preattentive processing works. It is useful for students learning about how we see, designers who want to make clear and easy-to-use interfaces, researchers studying how people use computers, and anyone curious about how our vision works.

Interactive Tests: The website has different simple tests where users spot color, form, and a combined test of form and color called the conjunctive test. Users can change settings like how many distractors appear and how long the screen blinks to find the target. Each test helps explain how we quickly notice certain features and why they catch our attention.`,
